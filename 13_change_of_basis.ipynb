For instance, suppose you are looking at a vector in the Euclidian space and you are giving it the coordinates: $\\vec{p} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$, but someone else, looking at the same point, can give the coordinates $\\vec{p'} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5/3 \\\\ 1/3 \\end{pmatrix}$. \n",
